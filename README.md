# Overview
This plugin utilizes the ALM Octane REST API to integrate with Microsoft Outlook. Using the plugin, you can import any ALM Octane items assigned to you into Microsoft Outlook and manage the items there, as tasks.

As **my items** are updated in ALM Octane, your Outlook task list is updated too.
You can re-sync any task in Outlook at any time, without having to perform a full synchronization.

# Integration detail

* The ALM Octane REST API updates tasks in the host application, Microsoft Outlook.
